# Automate The Boring Stuff With Python by Al Sweigart

In this repository I will upload all my solutions to the practice problems presented in Automate The Boring Stuff With Python ("ATBS"). I can guarantee that these solutions will not be the most efficient or pythonic code, but they will work as of 2018. As a self-taught programmer, ATBS has greatly motivated and helped me become a better coder. I hope these solutions will help you learn as well. 

**Big shout to Al Sweigart!**
